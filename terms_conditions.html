        <p>In addition to any opt-out feature provided by any
          of the services listed in this document, Users may learn more on how to generally opt out of interest-based
          advertising within the dedicated section of the Cookie Policy.</p>

          online</h4>
        <p>The Personal Data collected are used to provide
          the User with services or to sell goods, including payment and possible delivery.</p>
        <p>The Personal Data collected to complete the
          payment may include the credit card, the bank account used for the transfer, or any other means of payment
          envisaged. The kind of Data collected by Rydelane depends on the payment system used.</p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Automated decision-making
        </h4>
        <p>Automated decision-making means that a decision
          which is likely to have legal effects or similarly significant effects on the User, is taken solely by
          technological means, without any human intervention. Rydelane may use the User`'`s Personal
          Data to make decisions entirely or partially based on automated processes according to the purposes outlined
          in this document. Rydelane adopts automated decision-making processes as far as necessary to enter into or
          perform a contract
          between User and Owner, or on the basis of the User’s explicit consent, where such consent is required by
          the law.</p>
        <p>Automated decisions are made by technological
          means – mostly based on algorithms subject to predefined criteria – which may also be provided by third
          parties.</p>
        <p>The rationale behind the
          automated decision making is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>to enable or otherwise
              improve the decision-making process;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>to grant Users fair and
              unbiased treatment based on consistent and uniform criteria;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>to reduce the potential harm derived from
              human error, personal bias and the like which may potentially lead to discrimination or imbalance in the
              treatment of individuals etc.;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>to reduce the risk of User`'`s failure to
              meet their obligation under a contract. To find out more about the purposes, the third-party services,
              if any, and any specific rationale for</p>
            <p>automated decisions used
              within Rydelane , Users can check the relevant sections in this document.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Consequences of automated decision-making
          processes for Users and rights of Users subjected to it</h4>
        <p>As a consequence, Users subject to such
          processing, are entitled to exercise specific rights aimed at preventing or otherwise limiting the potential
          effects of the automated decisions taken.</p>
        <p>In particular, Users have the
          right to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>obtain an explanation about any decision
              taken as a result of automated decision-making and express their point of view regarding this decision;
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>challenge a decision by asking the Owner to
              reconsider it or take a new decision on a different basis;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>request and obtain from the
              Owner human intervention on such processing.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>To learn more about the User’s rights and the
          means to exercise them, the User is invited to consult the section of this document relating to the rights
          of the User.</p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Personal Data collected
          through sources other than the User</h4>
        <p>The Owner of Rydelane may have legitimately
          collected Personal Data relating to Users without their knowledge by reusing or sourcing them from third
          parties on the grounds mentioned in the section specifying the legal basis of processing.</p>
        <p>Where the Owner has collected Personal Data in
          such a manner, Users may find specific information regarding the source within the relevant sections of this
          document or by contacting the Owner.</p>

        <p>Users may in most cases opt-out of receiving push
          notifications by visiting their device settings, such as the notification settings for mobile phones, and
          then change those settings for Rydelane, some or all of the apps on the particular

    <p>To fully exercise your right to limit the use or
      disclosure of your sensitive personal information you can contact us at any time, using the contact details
      provided in this document.</p>

    <h4>What are the purposes for which we use your personal information?</h4>

      operational functioning of Rydelane and features thereof (“business purposes”). In such cases, your personal
      information will be processed in a fashion necessary and proportionate to the business

    <p>We collect the above-mentioned categories of personal information, either directly or
      indirectly, from you when you use Rydelane .</p>
    <p>For example, you directly provide your personal
      information when you submit requests via any forms on Rydelane . You also provide personal information
      indirectly when you navigate Rydelane, as personal information about you is automatically
      observed and collected.</p>
    <p>Finally, we may collect your personal information from
      third parties that work with us in connection with the Service or with the functioning of this Application and
      features thereof.
      <b>How we use the information we collect: disclosing of your personal information with third parties for
        a business purpose</b>
    </p>
    <p>For our purposes, the word “third party” means a
      person who is not any of the following: a service provider or a contractor, as defined by the CCPA.</p>
    <p>We disclose your personal information with the third
      parties
      <b>listed in detail in the section titled “Detailed information on the processing of Personal Data”
        within this document. </b>These third parties are grouped and categorized in accordance with the
      different purposes of processing.
    </p>

    <h4>Sale or sharing of your personal information</h4>
    <p>For our purposes, the word “sale”
      means any “selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring or otherwise
      communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic means, a consumer`'`s personal information
      by the business to
      <b>a third party, for monetary or other valuable consideration</b>”, as defined by the CCPA.
    </p>
    <p>This means that, for example, a sale can happen
      whenever an application runs ads, or makes statistical analyses on the traffic or views, or simply because it
      uses tools such as social network plugins and the like.</p>
    <p>For our purposes, the word “sharing” means any
      “sharing, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise
      communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer`'`s personal
      information by the business to a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising, whether or not for
      monetary or other valuable consideration, including transactions between a business and a third party for
      cross-context behavioral
      advertising for the benefit of a business in which no money is exchanged”, as defined by the CCPA.</p>
    <p>Please note that the exchange of personal
      information with a service provider pursuant to a written contract that meets the requirements set by the CCPA,
      does not constitute a sale or sharing of your personal information.</p>

    <h4>Your right to opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal information and how you can exercise it</h4>
    <p>We sell or share your personal information with the
      third parties
      <b>listed in detail in the section titled “Detailed information on the processing of Personal Data”
        within this document. </b>These third parties are grouped and categorized in accordance with the
      different purposes of processing.
    </p>
    <p>You have the right to opt out of the sale or sharing
      of your personal information. This means that whenever you request us to stop selling or sharing your personal
      information, we will abide by your request.</p>
    <p>Such requests can be made freely, at
      any time, without submitting any verifiable request.</p>
    <p>To fully exercise your right to opt out, you can
      contact us at any time using the contact details provided in this document.</p>
    <p>For a simplified opt-out method you can also use the
      privacy choices link provided on Rydelane .</p>
    <p>If you want to submit requests to opt out of the sale
      or sharing of personal information via a user-enabled global privacy control, like the Global Privacy Control
      (“<u>GPC</u>”), you are free to do so and we will abide by such request
      in a frictionless manner (as defined in the CPRA regulations). The GPC consists of a setting or extension in the
      browser or mobile device and acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the GPC signal.
      If
      you want to use GPC, you can download and enable it via a
      <u>participating browser</u> or browser extension. More information about downloading GPC is available
      <u>here</u>.
    </p>
    <p>We use any personal information collected from you in
      connection with the submission of your opt-out request solely for the purposes of complying with the opt-out
      request.</p>
    <p>Once you have opted out, we are required to wait at
      least 12 months before asking whether you have changed your mind.</p>
    <p>Your privacy rights under the California Consumer
      Privacy Act and how to exercise them The right to access personal information: the right to know and to
      portability</p>

    <h4>You have the right to request that we disclose to you:</h4>
    <ul>

      </li>
      <li>the sources from which the personal information is collected;
      </li>

        <p>the specific pieces of personal
          information we have collected about you.</p>
        <p>You also have
          <b>the right to know what personal information is sold or shared and to whom.</b>
        </p>
        <p>In particular, you have the right
          to request two separate lists from us where we disclose:</p>
      </li>
      <li>the categories of personal
        information that we sold or shared about you and the categories of third parties to whom the personal
        information was sold or shared;
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>the categories of personal information that we
          disclosed about you for a business purpose and the categories of persons to whom it was disclosed for a
          business purpose.</p>
        <p>The disclosure described above will be limited to
          the personal information collected or used over the past 12 months.</p>
        <p>If we deliver our response electronically, the
          information enclosed will be `"`portable`"`, i.e. delivered in an easily usable format to enable you to
          transmit the information to another entity without hindrance — provided
          that this is technically feasible.</p>

        <h4>The right to request the deletion of your personal information</h4>
        <p>You have the right to request that we delete any
          of your personal information, subject to exceptions set forth by the law (such as, including but not limited
          to, where the information is used to identify and repair errors on
          Transfeero, to detect security incidents and protect against fraudulent or illegal activities, to exercise
          certain rights etc.).</p>
        <p>If no legal exception applies, as a result of
          exercising your right, we will delete your personal information and notify any of our service providers and
          all third parties to whom we have sold or shared the personal information
          to do so — provided that this is technically feasible and doesn’t involve disproportionate effort.</p>
        <h4>The right to correct inaccurate
          personal information</h4>
        <p>You have the right to request that we correct
          any inaccurate personal information we maintain about you, taking into account the nature of the personal
          information and the purposes of the processing of the personal information.</p>
        <p>The right to opt out of sale or sharing of personal information and to limit the use of your sensitive
          personal information</p>
        <p>You have the right to opt out of the sale or
          sharing of your personal information. You also have the right to request that we limit our use or disclosure
          of your sensitive personal information.</p>
        <h4>The right of no retaliation following opt-out or
          exercise of other rights (the right to non-discrimination)</h4>
        <p>We will not discriminate against you for
          exercising your rights under the CCPA. This means that we will not discriminate against you, including, but
          not limited to, by denying goods or services, charging you a different
          price, or providing a different level or quality of goods or services just because you exercised your
          consumer privacy rights.</p>
        <p>However, if you refuse to provide your personal
          information to us or ask us to delete or stop selling your personal information, and that personal
          information or sale is necessary for us to provide you with goods or services,
          we may not be able to complete that transaction.</p>
        <p>To the extent permitted by the law, we may offer
          you promotions, discounts, and other deals in exchange for collecting, keeping, or selling your personal
          information, provided that the financial incentive offered is reasonably
          related to the value of your personal information.</p>

        <h4>How to exercise your rights</h4>
        <p>To exercise the rights described above, you need
          to submit your verifiable request to us by contacting us via the details provided in this document.</p>
        <p>For us to respond to your request, it’s necessary
          that we know who you are. Therefore, you can only exercise the above rights by making a verifiable request
          which must:</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>provide sufficient information that allows us to
          reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized
          representative;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>describe your request with sufficient detail
          that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We will not respond to any request if we are unable to
      verify your identity and therefore confirm the personal information in our possession actually relates to you.
    </p>
    <p>Making a verifiable consumer request does not require
      you to create an account with us. We will use any personal information collected from you in connection with the
      verification of your request solely for the purposes of verification
      and shall not further disclose the personal</p>
    <p>information, retain it longer than
      necessary for purposes of verification, or use it for unrelated purposes.</p>
    <p>If you cannot personally submit a verifiable request,
      you can authorize a person registered with the California Secretary of State to act on your behalf.</p>
    <p>If you are an adult, you can make a verifiable request
      on behalf of a child under your parental authority.</p>
    <p>You can submit a maximum number of 2
      requests over a period of 12 months.</p>

    <h4>How and when we are expected to handle your request</h4>
    <p>We will confirm receipt of your verifiable request
      within 10 days and provide information about how we will process your request.</p>
    <p>We will respond to your request within 45 days of its
      receipt. Should we need more time, we will explain to you the reasons why, and how much more time we need. In
      this regard, please note that we may take up to 90 days to fulfill
      your request.</p>
    <p>Our disclosure(s) will cover the preceding 12-month
      period. Only with regard to personal information collected on or after January 1, 2022, you have the right to
      request that we disclose information beyond the 12-month period, and
      we will provide them to you unless doing so proves impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort.</p>
    <p>Should we deny your request, we will
      explain you the reasons behind our denial.</p>
    <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your
      verifiable request unless such request is manifestly unfounded or excessive. In such cases, we may charge a
      reasonable fee, or refuse to act on the request. In either case, we will
      communicate our choices and explain the reasons behind it.</p>
